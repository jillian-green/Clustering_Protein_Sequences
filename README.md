# Clustering_Protein_Sequences

A phylogenetic tree uses genetic “closeness” to display the evolutionary relationships between different species. By finding the genetic distances between species, we can divide species into clusters and construct a phylogenetic tree for each cluster.

The goal of this project is to construct phylogenetic trees using a combination of embedding, PCA, and clustering. The clustering algorithms I focus on are k-means, hierarchical and density clustering methods on human protein sequences. Once the data is clustered, I will decide which cluster performs best and transform those clusters into phylogenetic trees. Finally, I will analyze the similarities and differences of trees to understand the successes and failures of the clustering algorithm.
