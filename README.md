# Clustering_Protein_Sequences

A phylogenetic tree uses genetic “closeness” to display the evolutionary relationships between different species. By finding the genetic distances between species, we can divide species into clusters and construct a phylogenetic tree for each cluster. I plan to explore this idea through k- means algorithm, a density based algorithm, and hierarchical clustering.
